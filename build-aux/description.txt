lrcon is a library for querying source servers in two parts: RCON and query.  The 
RCON protocol is for remotely managing servers, while the query part is for the 
public informational protocol used by steam.

Also distributed are three applications, 'lrcon', 'qrcon' and 'query', which perform 
the functions of their respective parts of the library.  Qrcon is a Qt-GUI 
version of the RCON application.

The applications are licensed under the GPLv3, whilst the library parts are under the 
LGPL.  This is clarified at the top of each file.
