lrcon is a library for querying source servers in two parts: RCON and query.  The 
RCON protocol is for remotely managing servers, while the query part is for the 
public informational protocol used by steam.

Also distributed are two applications, 'lrcon' and 'query', which perform the 
functions of their respective parts of the library.

The two applications are licensed under the GPLv3, whilst the library parts are
under the LGPL.

Full documentation is generated by doxygen.  One can re-generate it using different
setting using configure and/or make options, providing you have the doxygen 
program.
