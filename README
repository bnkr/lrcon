Installation

See INSTALL.

Usage
-----

There are two programs, lrcon and qrcon.  The first is a command-line program
whose usage is explained by the -h help text.  The qrcon program is a Qt4 GUI
which should be self explanatory.

Check the help text of each program.

The library parts are all in include/ and documented by doxygen in doc/*.
