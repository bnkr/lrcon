Mantainance
-----------

This is a rather ancient project which might not work particularly well any
more.  I expect an implementation in a scripting language with proper readline
support and so on would be rather more productive than what we have here.
Nevertheless, some of the implementation might be useful for curiosity at least.

Installation
------------

Use cmake as normal.  Dragons here since I never updated the buildsystem for
quite some time::

  $ sudo aptitude install libqt4-dev cmake
  $ mkdir _build
  $ cd _build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

There is currently no install target.

Usage::

  $ cd _build
  # qt4 gui
  $ ./bin/qrcon
  # Command-line shell
  $ ./bin/lrcon

Usage
-----

There are two programs, lrcon and qrcon.  The first is a command-line program
whose usage is explained by the -h help text.  The qrcon program is a Qt4 GUI
which should be self explanatory.

Check the help text of each program.

The library parts are all in include/.  Documentation can be generated by
doxygen.
