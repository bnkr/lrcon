\brief File to add doxygen todos.

\todo Make timeouts dynamic.
    - class timeout 
    - default one in conn, which can be changed by the user
    - otherwise one is given in the constructors of objects.

\todo Re-organise exceptions to accomodate query

\todo After query is done, look at if it's possible to share some of the reading
      code (well, as much of it as possible actually)

\todo I'm not sure about my method of warnings.  It's a bit bad to be printing out
      things in a library.  Much nicer to give the user a way to check for them,
      and these assertion type things can be turned off.
