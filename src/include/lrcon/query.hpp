\brief The public query interface to a server.

http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_Queries

This paradoxically seems to be a much more complicated protocol than RCON.

Steam uses a packet size of 1400 bytes + IP/UDP headers. If a request or response 
needs more packets for the data it starts the packets with an additional header in 
the following format: 

\verbatim
Data          Type          Comment  
Type          long          -2 (0xFFFFFFFE) to indicate that data is split over several packets 
Request ID    long          The server assigns a unique number to each split packet. (Source 
                            Engine only) If the top bit of the request ID is set then this 
                            packet has been compressed with the BZip2 algorithm before being 
                            split, after you get all the pieces you need to uncompress it with 
                            BZ2_bzBuffToBuffDecompress() before reading the raw data. 
Packet Number byte / short  (Half-Life 1)The lower four bits represent the number of packets (2 
                            to 15) and the upper four bits represent the current packet starting 
                            with 0. 
                            (Source Engine) The lower byte is the number of packets, the upper 
                            byte this current packet starting with 0. 
Size of the Splits   
             short         (Source Engine)For the new version of the source engine we changed the 
                           SPLITPACKET header slightly to include at the end a short which is the size 
                           of the splits (it used to be hard coded). In our games a user can request 
                           a smaller packet size before a split occurs, the default is 0x04e0 which 
                           is 1248 bytes. The query protocols, however, don't allow requesting 
                           a different split size, so the new default (1248) is what you should always 
                           see there. So if you are querying a TF2 server you need to account for 
                           that. A TF2 server op can also lower the max routable payload, so you can't 
                           guarantee that it'll always be 0x04e0.
\endverbatim

If the packet is compressed, there are two extra fields in the first packet. 
\verbatim
Data   Type       Comment 
  Type   integer    Number of bytes the data uses after decompression; 
  Type   integer    CRC32 checksum of the uncompressed data for validation.
\endverbatim

Because UDP packets can arrive in different order or delayed, every packet should be verified by 
its Request ID and the Packet Number! Every request or response with or without this header is 
continued with an integer -1 (0xFFFFFFFF) and the user data.

So by reading the first 4 bytes you can decide whether the data is split (-2) or in one packet (-1).

The players response has two sections, the initial header: 

\verbatim

Type          byte    Should be equal to 'D' (0x44) 
Num Players   byte    The number of players reported in this response 
\endverbatim

Then for each player the following fields are sent: 

\verbatim
 Data           Type     Comment 
Index           byte     The index into [0.. Num Players] for this entry

\par Basics/Certainties

- we have the send/recv. thing therefore it makes sense to have a send(command, return)
  function.  Another reason of course is that we can deal with out of order packets 
  easier.
- this can be implemented easily in the rcon interface.
- sends are all easy, except challenges which require a small ammount of state.

\par Problems

- what about ensureing sequencing?  I don't know how to implement that well.  Well, I do
  but it's hard!  Think about sliding window etc etc.

\par Guessing

- could do types again?  eg, send(rules_query(chal_num)).  Pretty decent way I believe.
  - hard to do return values tho, without having a big list of send(T1, T2)... which
    I suppose is actually ok.
- returning values?  It's a binary proto, clearly so we cant' do basic return like that.
  - I think the best way is to convert it with send(cmd, rcv) where rcv is a big packet
  - would send() do the converting, or the rcv?
  - cmd would be doing the converting to send, so for consistancy rcv might do the 
    conversion into proper data.  Also makes sense because rcv deffo should do its own
    validation.
- data structures.
  - mostly it's very easy to deal with.  A few vectors... maybe some templates for the 
    containers... nothing stressful.


\par Use Cases

\code
connection con(host("whatever"));
ping myping;
con.send(myping); // use the send type as the return
myping.latency();
\endcode

This one is likely the best.  The entire thing is a request/response thing so I 
think it makes the most sense.  You have to have two hierachies the other way.
It conflicts with teh design of the rcon proto tho.

\code
connection conn;
ping myping(conn);
myping.latency();
\endcode


\todo Write here a use case for each thingy.
