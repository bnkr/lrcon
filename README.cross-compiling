./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc && make clean && make

The host seems directly related to the names of the cross-compilers that are installed.
Configure fails to detect anything else anyway.

Seems to do it... blowed if I can actually make it compile though ^^.  Maybe cygwin is 
a better choice.  I would also need the full source of windows stuff for qt4, and 
presumably the dlls... bleh.  I'd rather link it on windows somehow.  Must be a pain
though.
