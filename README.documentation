Documentation is built only with the `dist' target.  If you want to rebuild, then
use 'make doxygen'.  The configuration is defined by 'cat ${DOXYFILE}' and then 
redefining some variables like the program name and version so you can easily
change the configuration.  Mostly you might want to turn off HAVE_DOT to get rid 
of the caller/callee graphs or, if you are distributing this, redefine INPUT_DIR
to just be include/ so only the library documentation is included.
